###Angular Review Notes 

###Promises and Callbacks 
$q -- this is a promises library 

JavaScript does not have a promise library built in. 
Promises are a better version of callbacks; more sophisticated, and more powerful. 

$q only uses callbacks. 
Angular really relies on $q, you can't ues it without in honestly.

###Factory -- makes a new instance of itself every time it's injected
Services don't, it just injects the SAME instance whenever else it's called after the first time. 

### .then ###
.then fires after the promise is fulfilled. Then we resolve the promise.
