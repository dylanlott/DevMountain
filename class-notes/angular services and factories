###angular services and angular notes

anything that doesn't have to do directly with your view, should be put in a service. 

#building a service 

var app = angular.module('superCool'); 

app.service('mainService', function(){
	console.log("service loaded"); 
	
	this.myProperty /*"this" is referencing the mainService object */

	this.countTheOdds = function(str){
		str = str.split('');
		var odds = 0; 
		for(var i = 0; i< str.length; i++){
			if(Number(str[i]) % 2 === 1 ){
				odds++; 
			}
		}
		return odds; 
	}
})

#injecting a service -- put it as a callback in the main app declaration 

#best design practices -- services should be concerned with state  

# state is the state of being such as "logged in" or "logged out" 

#variables in services -- 

#anything that calls myService has access to "this"

$http - dollar signs are angular built-in parts, don't use them in your own names 

#maker function = function that makes a new object, Factory is a maker function. Maker function returns the object. 

# constructor function = Service uses "new" keyword to create 

##your controller shouldn't have data in it. It should only handle data provided by services and factories. Controllers should HANDLE it, not create or store it.
